instructions:

1- Check whether Python is installed on your system by running the command python3 --version.
If it is not installed, follow the instructions provided in the
official Python documentation at https://www.python.org/downloads/ to install Python.

2- Once Python is installed on your system, create a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies.
You can create a virtual environment using the following command: `python -m venv .venv`
Check the documentation for your operating system to see if you need to install any additional packages.

3- Activate the virtual environment using the following command: `source .venv/bin/activate`
Check the documentation for your operating system to see if the command is different.

4- Install the required packages using the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5- Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the command jupyter-notebook.

6- Navigate to main-script.ipynb and run the code using the "Run All" button.
Make sure that the virtual environment is activated while running the notebook.
