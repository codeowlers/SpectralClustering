The data-sets of N points to be used are contained in the files Circle.csv and Spiral.csv. The file Circle.csv contains two columns
corresponding to x-values and y-values of the points; the file Spiral.csv contains
three columns, the third one contains the index of the correct cluster.

Recall that, given a similarity function s[i,j] for two points, the similarity
graph is denoted by G = (V, E), where V = v1, ..., vn denotes a non-empty
set of vertices and E denotes the set of edges, i.e., a set of pair of vertices.
In the similarity graph each vertex vi ∈ V represents a data point Xi. 
An edge between two vertices vi and vj exists if the similarity sij between the
corresponding data points Xi and Xj is either positive or larger than a certain
threshold (minimum similarity value ε for a connection to take place between
two data points). We assume that sij = sji and that the edge connecting vi
and vj is weighted by sij . Consequently, it turns out that the similarity graph
is undirected. The weighted adjacency matrix is defined as Wij = sij , if i != j
and Wij = 0, if i = j

For both the data-sets address the following items.

Given a set of data points X and the similarity function
si,j = exp ( -||Xi − Xj||**2 / 2σ**2),
construct the k-nearest neighborhood similarity graph and its adjacency
matrix W. Note that the adjacency matrix W has zero-values on the
diagonal by definition. Try several values of k = 10, 20, 40. Use σ = 1.
